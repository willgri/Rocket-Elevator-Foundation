# WEEK 4

This is a ruby on rails project for RocketElevators. The goal was to make an interactive website with
my original static website and link it to a database to store Employee login data and the quote data in
separate tables. The website have a backoffice that employee can login to acces the data from quote.

With the same website we extended the mySQL database with a lot more tables and data. The second database (postgreSQL) was used as a datawarehouse.
